# OS-EX-1-Assembling-the-System---CASE-STUDY

## AIM:
To build the complete assembly of the Computer System.

## STEPS:
### Step 1 : Open The Case
The First Step In Assembling A Computer Is To Open The Computer Case. To Open The Case, First Remove The Screws Of The Left Side Cover And Slide The Side Cover.

### Step 3 : Attach The Components To Motherboard
The Motherboard Has To Be Prepared Before Its Installation. To Prepare The Motherboard, You First Need To Install The CPU, Then The Heat Sink On The CPU And CPU Fan.

### Step 4 : CPU ASSEMBLY
A CPU Socket Uses A Series Of Pins To Connect A CPU Processor To The Pc’s Motherboard. If A CPU Is Connected Via A CPU Socket.

### Step 8 : Install internal drives
The Hard Drive Is The Device Which Stores All The Data. Connect The Power Cable Coming From The SMPS To The Power Socket Of Hard Disk Drive. Connect SATA Data Cable From Hard Disk Drive Socket To The Motherboard Socket.

### Step 9 : Connect all internal cables
Power Cables Are Used To Distribute Electricity From The Power Supply To The Motherboard And Other Components. Data Cables Transmit Data Between The Motherboard And Storage Devices, Such As Hard Drives.
